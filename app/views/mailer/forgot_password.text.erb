Below is a link to reset your BlueBird.club password.
It will expire at <%= DateTime.parse(@user.password_reset_expiration).strftime('%l:%M %P on %B %d, %Y') %>.
If you don't it by then, you can always generate a new expiration time.

localhost:3000/forgot_password/<%=@user.password_reset_token%>
As always, if you need assistance, feel free to reach out.

Your friends,
