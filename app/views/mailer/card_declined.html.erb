    <p>
      Looks like there was an error processing your payment on your purchase of <%= @commit.product.title %> using your <%= @card.brand %> **** **** **** <%= @card.last4 %>,
      not a big deal though. Please update your card as soon as possible and your order will go through without a hitch.
      However if you don't update your card within 7 days, BlueBird reserves the right to cancel your order.
