<%= @user.first_name %>,

Your product <%= @product.title %> on BlueBird.club has expired and you finished
your sale with $<%= @product.current_sales %> in sales, missing your goal of
$<%= @product.goal %>.

At this point you have two choices:
Expire the product, receive no sales
Grant the discount of $<%= @product.discount %>, and receive $<%= @product.current_sales %> in sales

Follow this link to do so: localhost:3000/users?redirect=/needs_attention

If you need any help with the process, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Your friends,
