Your order is on it's way, <%= @user.first_name %>!

You can expect your order(s) of:
<% @shipment.commits.each do |commit| %>
  <%= commit.amount %> <%= commit.product.title.pluralize %>
<% end %>
To arrive on <%= @tracking_delivery_date %> (estimated)

However, it looks like your card had some issues processing the <%= @charge %> fee.
This is not a big deal though, navigate to your profile and you will be instructed on how to fix this quickly.

The shipping carrier is <%= @tracking_carrier %>
Your tracking number: <%= @tracking_code %>
For more information: <%= @tracking_url %>

As always, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
